# Hi there, I'm Dipesh Kumar Bhandari ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a passionate and driven Computer Science student with a deep interest in Data Science and Front end development. I enjoy working on projects that allow me to learn and contribute to innovative solutions in the tech field.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in BSc.CSIT at Rajarshi Janak University. I am always eager to expand my skills and knowledge through hands-on experiences, and I strive to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in technology.

### Education
- **Bachelor's in Computer Science & Information Technology (BSc.CSIT)** - Rajarshi Janak University (Ongoing)
- **Higher Secondary School** - Mithila Institute of Technology

### Certifications
- **Meta Front-End Development** - Online Certification
- **Data Science** - This certification has equipped me with the skills to analyze complex data, build predictive models, and extract valuable insights for data-driven decision-making.


### project
- **Tiered project on Titanic Data Set** (Link:https://github.com/Dipesh360-wq/Titanic-Project.git): In this project, I applied machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on features like age, sex, class, and ticket information. Using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, I performed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and built predictive models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The project demonstrated my ability to handle missing data, engineer features, and evaluate models using accuracy and cross-validation. The goal was to build a model that could predict the likelihood of survival for passengers based on historical data.



### Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- **Data Science**: Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Visualization
- **Web Development**: Front-End ( HTML, CSS)
- **Tools & Technologies**: Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, MySQL,
- **Soft Skills**: Problem-solving, communication, teamwork, time management

### Interests
- **Data Science**: Exploring data to gain insights and develop predictive models.
- **Outing**: Enjoying nature and experiencing new places.
- **Singing**: A hobby that helps me relax and connect with music.
- **Writing**: Expressing my thoughts through writing and contributing to the community.

### Conferences & Participation
- **International Sustainable Development Research Conference (ISDRS) 2024**: Participated in the conference held in Kathmandu, Nepal, focusing on sustainable development research.
